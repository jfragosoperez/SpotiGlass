SpotiGlass
==========

App for controlling Spotify from Google Glass devices

As Spotify is working on a SDK, I will try to work not with the old way (searching and opening Spotify app using intent actions),
but using the SDK (although it's still a Beta). 

However, right now, I'll wait for a little bit to integrate the Beta till SSO auth. is supported. 
Have a look at this issue for further information. --> https://github.com/spotify/android-sdk/issues/26
